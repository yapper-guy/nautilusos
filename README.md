## NautilusOS

NautilusOS is a web-based operating system built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Boot it up, log in, and mess around like it’s a real desktop with proxies, games, apps, an app store, windows, a file explorer, taskbar, and more.

## 💡 more about

This is mostly just a fun UI sandbox with no backend or external data storage. It just seemed like the logical next step after Helios Browser.  
Everything runs client-side.  
Built with just HTML, CSS, and JS (no frameworks, no CDNs except icons/fonts)

## 🧠 try it

Open the NautilusOS-OneFile/index.html file in your browser. That’s it.
