## NautilusOS

NautilusOS is a web-based operating system built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Boot it up, log in, and mess around like it’s a real desktop with proxies, games, apps, an app store, windows, a file explorer, taskbar, and more.

NAUTILUS BLOCKED BY YOUR SCHOOL?? DOWNLOAD "index.html" from the NautilusOS-OneFile folder! Open up index.html and you'll have (most*) of Nautilus's features!

*Nautilus Browser is disabled by default in the file, but you may reenable it in the experimental settings under the BIOS (Left shift/F2 during boot), or in the experimental settings under Advanced. The Ultraviolet browser will not work in the file, unfortunately, due to service workers not working in file:/// or file:// url's :(

## 💡 more about

This is mostly just a fun UI sandbox with no backend or external data storage. It just seemed like the logical next step after Helios Browser.  
Everything runs client-side.  
Built with just HTML, CSS, and JS (no frameworks, no CDNs except icons/fonts)

---

## 🧠 try it

Open the NautilusOS-OneFile/index.html file in your browser. That’s it.
